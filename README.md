# Sketchy-Sketchy Keyboard

Below are some features of this keyboard:

* Fun case design based on the Etch-A-Sketch
* Layout focuses on only letters and numbers
* Use large ISO enter so that right hand can get the full set of home row keys (and it looks cool as well)
* 7u spacebar with no modifier keys to keep things clean and simple
* Dual rotary knobs (can be programmed to control horizontal and vertical mouse movements)
* Dual OLED screens, because why not

The OLED screens are not individually programmable. Theyâ€™re tied to the same I2C outputs, so they just mirror each other.
